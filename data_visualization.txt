We use the Neo4j to achieve the data visualization. Below are the codes to import the data and create the relationship in Neo4j graph database.

1. // Delete all existing node and relationship
MATCH (n)
DETACH DELETE n


2. // Create all nodes
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///all_node.csv' AS row
WITH row
create (a:`NODE` {`ADDRESS`:row.ADDRESS});


3. // Create relationships
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///transfers.csv' AS row
MATCH (p1:NODE {ADDRESS:row.FROM}), (p2:NODE {ADDRESS:row.TO})
CREATE (p1)-[:TRANSFER]->(p2);


4. // Display all existing nodes and relationships
Match (n)-[r]->(m)
Return n,r,m
